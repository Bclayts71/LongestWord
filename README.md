# LongestWord
To download and use the program you can download all of the files and save them in one folder.
Next run the main file which is the LongestWords.java file and it will prompt the user to input a random string of characters.
For example, the user could enter "koritoya" and the program will print out "troika" "troika" because those two words are the longest
arrangement of those two letters. The program works by sorting all of the words alphabetically and saving them in a dictionary. Then the program
compares all of the sorted word to the word in words.txt which is a list of real words. The program saves all of the words that appear in the
words.txt and finally iterates over them to see which word has the most letters. If there is a tie, then the program will print out all
of the words that have that max length.
